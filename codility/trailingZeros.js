// Write a function:


// that, given an array of N positive integers, returns the maximum number of trailing zeros of 
// the number obtained by multiplying three different elements from the array. Numbers 
// are considered different if they are at different positions in the array.
// For example, given A = [7, 15, 6, 20, 5, 10], the function should return 3 
// (you can obtain three trailing zeros by taking the product of numbers 15, 20 and 10 or 20, 5 and 10).
// For another example, given A = [25, 10, 25, 10, 32], the function should return 4 (you can obtain four trailing zeros 
// by taking the product of numbers 25, 25 and 32).
// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
// N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
// each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
